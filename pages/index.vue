      The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we
      call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to
      animals that may be trapped or in distress. We routinely get asked for
      information about the number of such incident attended by the London Fire
      Brigade and this data is published on the London Datastore to assist those
      who require it. The data is provided from January 2009 and isupdated
      monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including
      some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the
      data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal
      deaths or injuries. Please note that any cost included is a notional cost
      calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour
      spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at
      the current Brigade hourly rate. The London Fire Commissioner is the fire
      and rescue authority for London and runs the London Fire Brigade.
